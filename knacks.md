#Shapeshifting Charms

##Humble Mouse Shape

**Cost:** (11-Essence)m; **Mins:** Manipulation 3, Essence 2; **Type:** Simple<br />
**Keywords:** Combo-OK, Compulsion, Merged, Native, Shapeshifting<br />
**Duration:** One scene<br />
**Prerequisites:** None

The Decievers are well aquainted with small, unnoticable shapes, but sometimes
the alert will target them anyways.  Once activated, for the rest of the scene
the Deciever is clearly an ordinary creature that belongs there, and that it
is best to leave him alone.  Make a (Wits+Stealth) roll, anyone with a Dodge
MDV less than the successes is unwilling to do anything about the Decievers
small form.  This is an unnatural compulsion effect that costs 1wp to resist.
Entering a form larger than a mouse ends this charm permaturely.

##Emerald Grasshopper Form

**Cost:** +2m; **Mins:** Perception 4, Essence 3; **Type:** Supplimental<br />
**Keywords:** Combo-OK, Merged, Native, Shapeshifting<br />
**Duration:** New shape<br />
**Prerequisites:** Any Elemental shapeshifting Charm

Not satisfied with having to steal forms, the Proteans began to implant
features from their supernatural forms into others.  This gives their physical
form a trait associated with another form, increasing a single Attributes natural
rating by two.  For example, an emerald grasshopper has the skin of an Earth
Elemental, increasing its Stamina.  This benefit may be applied once to each
attribute the base form has, the cost must be paid at the time the form is
donned.

##Preys Skin Disguise

**Cost:** 8m; **Mins:** Manipulation 5, Essence 4; **Type:** Simple<br />
**Keywords:** Combo-Basic, Merged, Native, Shapeshifting, Shaping<br />
**Duration:** New Shape<br />
**Prerequisites:** Perfection of the Mockingbird

Not ones to give up a chance to convince others of their position, the
Decievers learned to mimic parts of a body.  This is both a shapeshifting
action and a Shaping attack, the Lunar becomes a new limb on the target.
Until the Lunar uses a charm like Humble Mouse Shape (which is allowed to make
the target believe the limb belongs there, and should leave it be) the target
will be shocked by the new limb, and usually tries to remove it by force.
The Lunar may then pay 2m to suppliment any mental attack against the target,
making it an Illusion effect, the subject will believe the attack was their
own suggestion.  The Lunar is capable of intuitively understanding what the
subject wants, should they attempt to use the Lunar.

At Manipulation 6, Essence 6, the Lunar is capable of becoming an existing
limb, they may passively obey the subjects will, or perform their own actions
with the limb.
