#Shapeshifting Charms

##Humble Mouse Shape

**Cost:** (11-Essence)m; **Mins:** Manipulation 3, Essence 2; **Type:** Simple
**Keywords:** Combo-OK, Compulsion, Merged, Native, Shapeshifting
**Duration:** One scene
**Prerequisites:** None

The Decievers are well aquainted with small, unnoticable shapes, but sometimes
the alert will target them anyways.  Once activated, for the rest of the scene
the Deciever is clearly an ordinary creature that belongs there, and that it
is best to leave him alone.  Make a (Wits+Stealth) roll, anyone with a Dodge
MDV less than the successes is unwilling to do anything about the Decievers
small form.  This is an unnatural compulsion effect that costs 1wp to resist.

*Merged:* Wits
