The Child is now a half-caste, is considered to have every Shape charm the mother and father have, but does not benefit from them, as they can not perform the sacred hunt.
They may learn Shaping Charms, but not Native or Shape Charms and are considered to have two forms: the form they would be born with without Fish or Fowl Gestation and the one they would have if one of the parents used it, the birthing parent selects which is the true form.
For a male Lunar to provide this benefit to his Children he must remain within his Essence miles of the womb.
