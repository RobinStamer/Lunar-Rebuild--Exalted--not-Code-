While the Unconquered Sun wishes for those who prove Excellence, Luna seeks those who adapt in the harshest of conditions.
When put into a situation where they can't win, can't survive, or just simply can not pass, they change the rules.
When lost without hope, in peril beyond measure, or merely in too deep, they survive.
Solar Exaltation is graceful compared to the raw, overwhelming power of the Lunar Exaltion.
When they first Exalt, they hear the Endless Song Beyond, driving them with its haunting hymm.
They wander, empowered, but with a nagging sense that they are now incomplete, that there is a hole to fill.
Within hours, but never more than a couple of days, they stumble upon something.
Something, they wish they could be, longing takes over like a craving never felt before, and then, the Song stops.
A pause, silence.
Everything is so still, the breeze unmoving, the sands, snow and leaves frozen in mid-air.
A forever, lacking any change, a nightmare where all the adaptations in existance are useless.
The young Hunter feels like they haven't had a heart-beat in eons.

Then a single rhythmic heartbeat, like a rebel yell it fills the scene, its dull echo gently nudging the scene into motion, that which is so longed for begins to resist like the photographs in the precious family album fight against the oncoming housefire.
Then the Screaming.
Carnage, raw undilluted contest, a battle, the scene explodes into vibrant motion.
Everything becomes less real, the fox dashes through the burning underbrush, the rabbit runs late down the endless hole, the fire hides under rocks and the boundless water dances away.
The horrible, Instinctual Screaming, an unsatiable lover demanding the entire moon be swallowed whole.
As the frantic scene plays out, one thing long held dear slowly slips away, but the longing is so close. . . a treat just on the snout.
With a flick of the head, it becomes so hapless, falling through the air, it lost.

Finally, understanding the extent of the truely irrevokable thing that conspired, a wave of dread and hope, that which was once held dear, slowly washed away.
The new Hunter stands, broken apart by their effort in the Hunt, they understand why, and how.
No longer confined by such a simple thing as a singular physical body in which to stalk Creation, they see their mortal self crushed beneath the waves as the Screaming becomes the Song once again.
