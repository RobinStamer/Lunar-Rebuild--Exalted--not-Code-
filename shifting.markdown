#Shapeshifting Rules

 * Shapeshifting is a Speed 7 action with a -2 DV penalty
 * When taking a new form, the Lunar shifts her dots of Strength, Dexterity,
Stamina and Appearance so that they are all lower than the new form's.  If the
Lunar desires to keep dots in excess of the form's limits she becomes the form
with traits that clearly identify her as a Lunar Exalted, otherwise the dots
are lost for the duration of the form.  Forms with no listed Appearance are
assumed to have an Appearance of 1
 * For the purpose of meeting Charm minimums and xp advancement the Lunar's
original form is used.
 * For the following Abilities the Lunar may use the form's Abilities up to 3:
Athletics, Awareness, Dodge, Larcent, Presence, Resistance, Ride, Stealth and
Survival
 * Tell starts at 25 successes, drops by 2 successes for each point of Limit
 * Default valid: human, animal and those between them without being
supernatural or capable of spending motes naturally (other Exalted are
considered to never meet this requirement)
Must be able to physically kill the target and devour the Heart's Blood
 * No more true forms, the first animal form is brutally hunted immediately
after Exaltation
 * Those that have seen the Tell before ignore two successes
 * Tell can be influenced by any form the Lunar has, which can be changed by
spending a point of temporary willpower and meditating for an hour
