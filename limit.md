Unlike Dragon-Blooded, Solar or Sidereal Limit Breaks, the Great Curse bestowed a blatantly obvious curse on the Hunters.
When a Hunter enters Limit Break she is driven to an extreme and compelled to enter the form she would use to satisfy that drive, and will continue to shift to keep in the most qualified form for the situation.
When first discovered, the Hunters were outraged that they had such a horrible flaw, and shouted angry prayers at their matron, Luna, who was completely caught off-guard by such a development.
She insisted that she had no part in such a thing, and worked with her Children so fix the error.
Frustrated they turned their anger against Autochton, the very Great Maker that made their blessing and curse possible.
He himself was baffled that they would assume that this was not simply a flaw with them, but agreed to look into the issue non-the-less.
FLUFF FLUFF YELLING FLUFF.
Eventually they discovered the EXTREMELY boring solution of killing fae, and staying out of DEEP WYLD.

##Limit Breaks

###Curse of Hunger

A good hunter carries a stock of food with her all the time.
One doesn't always have the chance to get more food when hungry, such as when wounded.
But not even months of rations can sustain a Hunter under this Curse.

At the 6-8 level, HUNGER

At the 9-10 level, endless hunger consumes the Exalt, she must attempt to consume everything she is capable of seeing, and has a form that can consume it.  Should she have charms that enable her to safely devour everything, she must use it.

###Curse of Thrall

As any good predator sneaks up to his prey, a hunter must conceal himself.
The less distance to chase one's prey the better, one is not an infinite fount of energy.
However, those Hunters who fall under this curse forgo such nicities.

At the 6-8 level, the Hunter finds he can not bear to be ignored, and must spend a point of Temporary Willpower to let someone leave his presence or turn their back on him.  Otherwise he must somehow get them to stay, or meet his gaze.

At the 9-10 level, the Exalt simply must be observed by everyone.  He must change form into something that attracts and maintains attention, anyone who fails to give him attention must be coerced by any means to place their eyes upon him.
